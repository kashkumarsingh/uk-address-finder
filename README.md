# UK Address Finder

**A WordPress plugin for finding UK addresses based on postal code.** This plugin allows users to enter a postal code, get address suggestions in real-time, and select an address from the suggestions. Users can also enter their address manually if no suggestions are available.

## Features
- **Postal Code Validation**: Validates UK postal codes to prevent invalid requests.
- **Real-Time Address Suggestions**: Fetches address suggestions dynamically using an API.
- **Error Handling and Feedback**: Shows error messages for invalid postal codes and displays manual address input if no suggestions are available.
- **Loading Indicator**: Provides visual feedback while fetching address suggestions.
- **Accessibility and Responsiveness**: Accessible forms and optimized layout for all devices.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository into your `wp-content/plugins` directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/uk-address-finder.git
    ```
2. Activate the plugin in your WordPress admin under **Plugins** > **Installed Plugins**.

3. Add the address finder form to any page by including the form template or a shortcode (if available).

## Usage
- Enter a valid UK postal code in the input field.
- Suggestions will appear in the dropdown if the postal code is valid.
- If the postal code is invalid, an error message will display.
- You can also choose to enter your address manually if no suggestions are available.

## Code and Concepts
- **Postal Code Handler**: Manages input validation and triggers suggestions fetching.
- **Address Suggestions Service**: Handles the logic to retrieve address suggestions from the API.

## Future Improvements
- **Performance Optimization**: Further reduce time complexity, CPU usage, and improve memory management.
- **Error Handling**: Expand error handling and provide more user-friendly messages.
- **Security**: Enhance security checks and validate user input more strictly.
- **Async Loading**: Optimize address suggestions to load asynchronously for even faster performance.
