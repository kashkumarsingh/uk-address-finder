# UK Address Finder

**A WordPress plugin that enables users to find UK addresses based on postal codes.** With this plugin, users can input a postal code, receive real-time address suggestions, and choose from a list of suggestions. In cases where no suggestions are found, users can manually enter their address.

## Features
- **Postal Code Validation**: Ensures only valid UK postal codes are accepted.
- **Real-Time Address Suggestions**: Fetches address suggestions based on postal code via an API.
- **Error Handling & Feedback**: Displays error messages for invalid postal codes and allows manual address input when no suggestions are available.
- **Loading Indicator**: Shows a visual cue while the address suggestions are being fetched.
- **Accessibility & Responsiveness**: Ensures the form is accessible, responsive, and optimized for all devices.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository into the `wp-content/plugins` directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kashkumarsingh/uk-address-finder.git
    ```

2. Activate the plugin through the WordPress admin interface under **Plugins** > **Installed Plugins**.

3. Add the address finder form to any page using the form template or shortcode (if available).

## Usage

- Enter a **valid UK postal code** in the input field.
- If valid, **address suggestions** will appear in a dropdown.
- If the postal code is **invalid**, an **error message** will be shown.
- If no suggestions are available, users can **manually enter their address**.

## File Structure

The plugin follows a modular structure for easy maintainability:


### Explanation of Key Files and Directories:

1. **`assets/`**: Contains front-end assets.
   - **`css/`**: Includes stylesheets (compiled from SCSS, if applicable).
   - **`js/`**: Contains JavaScript files for dynamic functionality.
   - **`handlers/`**: Event-driven logic files, such as `postal-code-handler.js` for managing postal code validation.
   - **`services/`**: Manages external API requests, e.g., `address-suggestions.js` for fetching address data based on postal code.
   - **`uk-address-finder.js`**: The main script that brings together all functionality.

2. **`templates/`**: Contains PHP templates for rendering the address input form.
   - **`form-template.php`**: The primary form template.

3. **`includes/`**: Contains PHP classes and core logic for the plugin.
   - **`class-uk-address-finder.php`**: Handles the plugin’s core functionality, such as registering actions, filters, and processing API requests.

4. **`uk-address-finder.php`**: The main plugin file that initializes all components.

## Code and Concepts

### SOLID Principles

The plugin follows the **SOLID** principles to ensure high-quality, maintainable, and extensible code:

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each class and function has one responsibility, such as validating postal codes, fetching address suggestions, or managing UI interactions.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: The plugin is designed to be open for extension but closed for modification. New features or address sources can be added without modifying existing code.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Inheritance is used appropriately, and derived classes can replace base classes without affecting the functionality.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Interfaces are designed to be minimal and specific to the needs of the implementing class.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: The plugin relies on abstractions, not concrete implementations, allowing for more flexibility and easier testing.

### Design Patterns

This plugin uses several design patterns to ensure extensibility and maintainability:

- **Factory Pattern**: For creating instances of services such as address suggestions and postal code validation, ensuring decoupling and easier modifications.
- **Observer Pattern**: To manage changes in the postal code input and dynamically update the UI with suggestions.
- **Strategy Pattern**: For handling different validation methods or APIs, depending on the use case, making it easier to extend.

### Maintainability, Reusability, and Expandability

- **Modular Design**: The plugin's modular structure, where different functionalities (e.g., postal code handling, address suggestions) are encapsulated into separate files, allows easy updates, bug fixes, and additions of new features.
- **Reusability**: Core functions like postal code validation and address fetching are reusable across different parts of the plugin and other projects.
- **Expandability**: The plugin’s architecture allows new features, like support for additional countries or custom validation rules, to be added without significant changes to the existing code.

### Testability

- **Unit Testing**: Key components, such as postal code validation and address fetching, can be unit-tested independently for reliability and robustness.
- **Mocking & Stubbing**: External API calls are abstracted into services, allowing easy mocking for testing purposes.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: The modular and decoupled structure facilitates TDD, ensuring the plugin remains bug-free during development.

## Future Improvements

- **Performance Optimization**: Further reduce time complexity, optimize CPU usage, and improve memory management.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Expand error handling to provide more user-friendly messages.
- **Security Enhancements**: Improve security checks and validate user inputs more thoroughly.
- **Async Loading**: Implement asynchronous loading for address suggestions to improve performance.
